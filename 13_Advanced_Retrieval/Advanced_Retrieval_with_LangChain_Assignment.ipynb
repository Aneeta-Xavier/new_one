That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.\")"

This act of brutality provokes John Wick to seek revenge against those who wronged him. As he reenters his deadly profession, he faces a relentless pursuit by bounty-hunting killers, Russian gangsters, and other enemies, all while trying to find peace after losing his wife and beloved dog.
